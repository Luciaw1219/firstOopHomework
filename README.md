Notes from chapter 2 and 3 

when designing a class we have to think about
things that the object knows and things that the objects does

instance variable-- object knows
methods-- things the object can do

a variable is just like a cup that holds something

every element in a array is just a variable 
in an array of type int each element can hold
an int
